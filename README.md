 virtual merchandising, virtual advertising and gaming. The Metavision 
 universe consists of 3 sub-worlds called Vision, Tron and Metastreet.

 experience situations that they cannot experience. To facilitate human 
 life, to make it easier to reach the desired to be reached, to provide 
 the Metaverse experience and to build the future of the Metaverse together

 the Metaverse in all areas. Users can join this world as a single player or 
 multi-player and will be able to create their own avatars in their online world.
